# PictureShapedWindow
Qt example: a non-rectangular window.
The shape follows that of a background image file (PNG with transparent parts).
Controls: mouse drag (only for non-transparent areas), exit by the context menu.

Based on the Qt "Shaped Clock Example"
(http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-shapedclock-example.html)

Tested on Windows 7.
